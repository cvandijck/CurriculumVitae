abstract = {Computed tomography is used more routinely to design patient-specific instrumentation for knee replacement surgery. Its moderate imaging cost and simplified segmentation reduce design costs compared with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, but it cannot provide the necessary cartilage information. Our method based on statistical shape modelling proved to be successful in predicting tibiofemoral cartilage in leave-one-out experiments. The obtained accuracy of 0.54 mm for femur and 0.49 mm for tibia outperforms the average cartilage thickness distribution and reported inter-observer MR segmentation variability. These results suggest that shape modelling is able to predict tibiofemoral cartilage with sufficient accuracy to design patient-specific instrumentation.},

Non-rigid deformation (NRD) deforms generic onto personalized bone geometry and thereby transforms the muscle points. The goal of this study was to determine to what extent the models and simulation outcomes in CP patients differ when including subject-specific detail using NRD or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based models. The NRD models slightly overestimated hip contact forces compared to MRI models and differences in muscle point positions and moment arm lengths (MALs) remained, although differences were smaller than for the generic model.},

abstract = {Background: Assessment of glenoid bone defects is important to select the optimal glenoid component design during shoulder arthroplasty planning and implantation. This study presents a fully automated method to describe glenoid bone loss using 3-dimensional measurements without the need for a healthy contralateral reference scapula. Methods: The native shape of the glenoid is reconstructed by fitting a statistical shape model (SSM) of the scapula. The total vault loss percentage, local vault loss percentages, defect depth, defect area percentage, and subluxation distance and region are computed based on a comparison of the reconstructed and eroded glenoids. The method is evaluated by comparing its results with a contralateral bone–based reconstruction approach in a data set of 34 scapula and humerus pairs with unilateral glenoid bone defects. Results: The SSM-based defect measurements deviated from the contralateral bone–based measurements with mean absolute differences of 5.5{\%} in the total vault loss percentage, 4.5{\%} to 8.0{\%} in the local vault loss percentages, 1.9 mm in the defect depth, 14.8{\%} in the defect area percentage, and 1.6 mm in the subluxation distance. The SSM-based method was statistically equivalent to the contralateral bone–based method for all parameters except the defect area percentage. Conclusion: The presented method is able to automatically analyze glenoid bone defects using 3-dimensional measurements without the need for a healthy contralateral bone.},

abstract = {Background Description of the native shape of a glenoid helps surgeons to preoperatively plan the position of a shoulder implant. A statistical shape model (SSM) can be used to virtually reconstruct a glenoid bone defect and to predict the inclination, version, and center position of the native glenoid. An SSM-based reconstruction method has already been developed for acetabular bone reconstruction. The goal of this study was to evaluate the SSM-based method for the reconstruction of glenoid bone defects and the prediction of native anatomic parameters. Methods First, an SSM was created on the basis of 66 healthy scapulae. Then, artificial bone defects were created in all scapulae and reconstructed using the SSM-based reconstruction method. For each bone defect, the reconstructed surface was compared with the original surface. Furthermore, the inclination, version, and glenoid center point of the reconstructed surface were compared with the original parameters of each scapula. Results For small glenoid bone defects, the healthy surface of the glenoid was reconstructed with a root mean square error of 1.2 ± 0.4 mm. Inclination, version, and glenoid center point were predicted with an accuracy of 2.4° ± 2.1° 2.9° ± 2.2° and 1.8 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. Discussion and conclusion The SSM-based reconstruction method is able to accurately reconstruct the native glenoid surface and to predict the native anatomic parameters. Based on this outcome, statistical shape modeling can be considered a successful technique for use in the preoperative planning of shoulder arthroplasty.},

abstract = {Preoperative determination of implant size for total knee arthroplasty surgery has numerous clinical and logistical benefits. Currently, surgeons use X-ray-based templating to estimate implant size, but this method has low accuracy. Our study aims to improve accuracy by developing a machine learning approach that predicts the required implant size based on a 3D femoral bone mesh, the key factor in determining the correct implant size. A linear regression framework imposing group sparsity on the 3D bone mesh vertex coordinates was proposed based on a dataset of 446 MRI scans. The group sparse regression method was further regularized based on the connectivity of the bone mesh to enforce neighbouring vertices to have similar importance to the model. Our hypergraph regularized group lasso had an accuracy of 70.1{\%} in predicting femoral implant size while the initial implant size prediction provided by the instrumentation manufacturer to the surgeon has an accuracy of 23.1{\%}. Furthermore, our method was capable of predicting the implant size up to one size smaller or larger with an accuracy of 99.1{\%}, thereby surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. The hypergraph regularized group lasso was able to obtain a significantly higher accuracy compared to the implant size prediction provided by the instrumentation manufacturer.},
